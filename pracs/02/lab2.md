## Preparation

### Question 2
The stored-program concept means that data and instructions are stored in memory. And as data is required, it is loaded from memory. This data is then used by the program, and then any results from operations performed on this data can then be stored back into memory, which can be used later. This is different from storing all data in the registers. Data needs to be loaded from memory, into the registers, or written from a register into memory.
